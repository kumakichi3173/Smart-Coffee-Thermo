# Smart-Coffee-Thermo

Problem:  When beverages or foods are prepared, oftentimes they are too hot to eat. Therefore, people must take their time to ensure they cool down. However, this requires attention and constantly  checking up on the food, which wastes the user’s time.  

Concept:  My idea is to create a sort of heat detection device that will notify users of specific target temperatures being reached in various foods and drinks. For instance, people sometimes have coffee, but it is too hot to drink. A remedy to this problem would be attaching some sort of device that will sense the amount of heat in the cup, and the user would be notified when it reaches a target temperature. This would ensure people would eat food or drink beverages at the optimal temperature and time without having to constantly check for the best time to eat.
